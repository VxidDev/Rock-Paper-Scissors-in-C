# Rock Paper Scissors (C)

A simple Rock Paper Scissors game written in C.  

This project was created as an early practice in C programming and demonstrates basic concepts such as:  

- Loops (`while`)
- Functions (`showScore`)
- Conditional statements (`if`, `switch`)
- Random number generation (`rand()` and `srand(time(NULL))`)
- String handling (`fgets()`, `strcmp()`)  

The game allows the user to choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors (by typing the word or number), and then plays against a computer opponent that randomly picks a choice. Scores are displayed after each round.  

This project is intended as a learning exercise and is a first step into creating interactive programs in C.
